### Story
A 4 year old project which was my principle with programming and so the gleam of an amateur (back then). This was a project I had developed in my skiddie days. I was hugely amateur and bad at programming. I didn't know one concept or algorithm. 

I often got DMs from people they always say where is ACDS? Every time I heard that question I was embarrassed because it was a very amateur project. The source was so sh*t. 

This was actually my principle to current and driven programming. Every programmer starts first at A no one can get to Z right away. ACDS was my principle too. My motivation source to continue growing. And I succeeded.
